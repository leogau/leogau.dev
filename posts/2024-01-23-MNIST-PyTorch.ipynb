    "In this post, I'll show you how I build a neural network to identify articles of clothes from the Fashion MNIST dataset. Fashion MNIST is a direct drop-in replacement for the popular MNIST dataset so it shares the same 28x28 image size and structure of MNIST.\n",

    "The training set contains 60,000 images of clothes associated with 10 different classes. The task is to classify a given image as the correct article of clothing.\n",
